> A declarative and reactive Angular renderer for [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/)

## Experimental Status

As of now, there is no release of this package just yet. Itâ€™s currently more of an experiment.
At the very latest, Iâ€™ll make the first release after implementing some demo scenarios and collecting more experience with the library.
Iâ€™m happy about any feedback you have on the library!

## Acknowledgements

I was heavily inspired by [angular-three](https://github.com/angular-threejs/angular-three), and especially by [Chau Tran (aka nartc)](https://github.com/nartc), who generously supported me throughout the development process whenever I had questions. In fact, much of the core library is essentially a modified version of angular-threeâ€™s code, adapted to work with PixiJS.
